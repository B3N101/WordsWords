# VocabPrep

## Description
A vocabulario trainer built by Middlesex School Students

## Engineering
VocabPrep is a web app built with NextJs, React, a Rust backend that uses PostgreSQL.

The website is designed for teachers' access to student learning and for students to effectively master new vocabulary. 

The intended purpose is for students to learn new 10 words a week until they reach mastery online so that students can be given a 20-word quiz biweekly.

The site will use time-based and browser-locking methods to prevent cheating which ultimately would lead to poor results on in-person quizzes.

This site will use gamify techniques to improve vocabulary understanding and memorization.

Lastly, this site will incorporate vocab from old lists to maintain past vocab knowledge.

## Data Collected
- Time spent by a student
- Level of mastery per mastery and per list
- Consistency
- Question type-specific data: definition, context, spelling, etc
